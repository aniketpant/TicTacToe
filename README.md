TicTacToe
=========

I have been trying to learn Ruby recently and I applied for the [apprenticeship program](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) by [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com/). The first task is to make an unbeatable AI for a Tic Tac Toe game.

It's quite interesting how a small game like this can be made interesting in terms of the code when you have the freedom to make an AI that cannot be beaten.

## Instructions

Run the program by `ruby start.rb`

## Notes

The code is very messy as I am still learning the language. I wanted to clean the entire the code and start afresh and I am going to do it. This works for now.
